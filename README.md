# Determine Recipient Plugin for GRAV

This **plugin** for [Grav](http://github.com/getgrav/grav) gives you the ability to alter email recipients depending on form values. This plugin is a cookbook example and cannot be used out of the box (unless your requirements and field names happen to be the exact same as mine).
